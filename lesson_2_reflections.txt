What happens when u initialize a repository?  Why do
you need to do it?

It sets up the metadata in a hidden '.git' directory.
This is necessary to keep track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?  What value do u think it offers?

Each is a separate space in order to keep the content in
dev, staging, and Prod modes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?

You can compare and this will help you decide where a logical
point is.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in
keeping your history organized?

When you want to try changes, but do not want to
'break the build'

How do the diagrams help you visual the branch structure?

Helps by seeing where things might have gotten orphaned.

What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why
do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

All the changes found in both are combined, it allows us
to have separation until we are ready to introduce wild
new changes.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs.
always doing merges manually?

The pros are u always can see the changes, the only con is
that u have to always see the changes.  :)
