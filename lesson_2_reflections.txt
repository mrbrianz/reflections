What happens when u initialize a repository?  Why do
you need to do it?

It sets up the metadata in a hidden '.git' directory.
This is necessary to keep track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?  What value do u think it offers?

Each is a separate space in order to keep the content in
dev, staging, and Prod modes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?

You can compare and this will help you decide where a logical
point is.
