What happens when u initialize a repository?  Why do
you need to do it?

It sets up the metadata in a hidden '.git' directory.
This is necessary to keep track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?  What value do u think it offers?

Each is a separate space in order to keep the content in
dev, staging, and Prod modes.
