When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably when u are collaborating on a project, or using multiple computers.

Why might yu want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if u are collaborating, u may not want the remote changes to be merged yet
