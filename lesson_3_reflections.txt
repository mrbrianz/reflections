When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably when u are collaborating on a project, or using multiple computers.

Why might yu want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if u are collaborating, u may not want the remote changes to be merged yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would u useone instead
of another?

Branches are just offshoots of the code, and done locally.  Clones are complete
copies of a repo.  And Forks are the same as clones, but are done on the remote server,
in this case on github.
